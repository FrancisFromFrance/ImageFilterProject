# ImageFilterProject
Working on a project that involved using a convolution kernel and a scanner to generate an image filter helped me to solidify my understanding of Java programming. Through the process I was able to apply my knowledge of Java concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, and control structures in a real-world scenario. I also gained practical experience in using Java libraries such as ImageIO and Scanner, which enhanced my ability to work with APIs and integrate different components in a project. This project provided me with hands-on experience in developing and solving complex problems, which helped me to deepen my understanding of Java programming and the software development process.



### Prerequisites
    • Java 8 or higher

### Running the Program
    1. Download and compile the repository
    2. Compile and run the KernelRunner.java file
    3. Users must navigate using a switch case
    4. Select an image using the file chooser or choose the default. Press ‘Y’ to confirm your choice.
    5. Choose a kernel from the switch case
    6. Use the ‘Save Image’ case to select the name for the filtered image.

### Supported Kernels
    1. Identity
    2. Edge Detection 1
    3. Edge Detection 2
    4. Laplacian
    5. Sharpen
