# ImageFilterProject
A project for applying an image to a image using a convolution kernel

### Overview
This program allows the user to input an image and apply a convolution kernel to apply an effect on the image.

### Prerequisites
    • Java 8 or higher

### Running the Program
    1. Download and compile the repository
    2. Compile and run the KernelRunner.java file
    3. Users must navigate using a switch case
    4. Select an image using the file chooser or choose the default. Press ‘Y’ to confirm your choice.
    5. Choose a kernel from the switch case
    6. Use the ‘Save Image’ case to select the name for the filtered image.

### Supported Kernels
The following kernels are currently supported:
    1. Identity
    2. Edge Detection 1
    3. Edge Detection 2
    4. Laplacian
    5. Sharpen
    6. Sobel Horizontal
    7. Sobel Vertical
